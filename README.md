# fab - Voice Analysis Package

Welcome to `fab` - short for "Fabio's Audio Box". `fab` is a python package for analyzing audio recordings containing voice and speech with the aim to ensure reproducible results and easy-to-run code. 
Whether you're a seasoned researcher or a curious enthusiast, `fab` simplifies audio tasks and streamlines your experiments. Embrace the power of reproducibility as you delve into the world of audio processing with confidence.

*This package is currently in progress, so please expect some bugs and inconsistencies.*


## Installation

To install `fab`, first you will have to set up some environment variables in the `config.sh` file:
```
env_name="fab" # you can always change this name üò•
conda_sh="<INSERT HERE THE PATH TO YOUR /conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh file>"
```

Next, you can simply run the following command in your terminal:
```
source myscript.sh
```

This command will create a Conda environment called `fab` (or something else depending on your preference üò•), clone all the required repositories, install all dependencies, download all required pretrained models, and activate the `fab` environment. Once the command has finished running, you should see a message indicating that the `fab` environment is active and ready to use.
