# Fab - Voice Analysis Package

Welcome to Fab - a voice analysis package that aims to help you analyze and visualize audio recordings of human speech. This package is currently in progress, so please expect some bugs and inconsistencies.

## Installation

To install Fab, simply run the following command in your terminal:

'''
source myscript.sh
'''


This command will create a Conda environment called `fab`, clone all the required repositories, install all dependencies, and activate the `fab` environment. Once the command has finished running, you should see a message indicating that the `fab` environment is now active and ready to use.
